## Prototype

- Initial UI and matcher

    The initial matcher utilizes [`fuzzywuzzy`](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy). Each row of the dataset is
    matched to the PSGC reference file per available interlevel following this process:
    - Check for exact string/substring match. If one or more is found, go to the next interlevel
    - If no exact match is found, then use `fuzzywuzzy` to find the top ten likely candidates. The likely candidates
      are chosen by score. There is a minimum score set and if the results scored below that, then no match will
      be returned
    - After finding match candidates, the matcher will proceed to the next interlevel and do the same logic but
      only match it against a subset of the reference file, filtered by the found matches

    Each interlevel match is represented as a row in the match results with the index being the same as the dataset's
    row number being matched. A sample result for one dataset row is below:

    index | code | interlevel | location | province_code | city_municipality_code | score |
    | --- | ---  | ---------- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
    | 0 | 042106010 | Bgy | Barangay Sabang | 042100000 | 042106000 | 100 |
    | 0 | 042106000 | City | City of Dasmari√±as | 042100000 | 042106000 | 100 |
    | 0 | 042100000 | City | Province of Cavite | 042100000 | 042100000 | 100 |

    This will then be joined based on the `city_municipality_code` and `province_code` fields resulting to a single
    candidate match row. The match type be computed based on the score with perfect scores marked as `exact`.
    Dataset rows with no match are marked as such while multiple possible matches are marked as `near` so the user
    can choose the correct match manually.
